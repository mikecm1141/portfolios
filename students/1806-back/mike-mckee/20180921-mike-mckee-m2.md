# Mike McKee - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

The goal I had going into this module was to learn the principles of MVC
design. I also wanted to begin strengthening my knowledge of ActiveRecord and
ORMs in general. Rails, of course, was also something I was interested in learning
to a great extent. I also wanted to further improve my knowledge of Ruby
and my thought process when tackling logical problems.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of this module, I worked on a project called BingeHelper. I wanted
to build a minimalistic, mobile-first application that could be useful to others,
and to start working with some light API work to help seed databases.

#### BingeHelper

BingeHelper is an application to help users find TV shows that are worth binge watching.
The idea behind this application is that users can log in and submit two types of 
ratings for shows. One is a regular, plain old 1-10 rating and the other is how many
episodes they watch on average per session. I used these pieces of data, along with
how long each episode is, to determine something called a BingeScore. The higher a BingeScore,
the better a show would be to binge. It was made with a mobile first mindset, so that people could
comfortably rate their favorite shows (or not so favorite!) from the comfort of their own couch or
favorite chair.

I learned a lot about working on a small-ish size project, coming up with an algorithm for
the BingeScore calculation, working with a basic API call to get data about TV shows, and
working with a different CSS framework (I used Materialize).

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Little Shop

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/little-shop-redux)

Little Shop was an application that further expanded upon our Black Thursday
project in Module 1. In this application, we used Sinatra to build out a web 
application that was seeded with sales data from Etsy. A visitor could view all
items, see lists of merchants, and check out invoices and their line items. There was
also some light data manipulation and analysis through dashboards.

Our main feedback for this project was using Ruby where ActiveRecord would have been
the better solution. Looking back now I could easily do many of the things we struggled
with back then with a great solution today.

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/TCraig7/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/job-tracker)

Job Tracker was our frst project made in Rails. It takes a user that can add companies,
categories, and jobs, and some information that relates to them to help keep track of
jobs that a user may have some interest in, jobs that have been applied to, and jobs
that have been offered.

Our main feedback during this evaluation was that some controller logic could have
been better, some testing issues and a few Git issues.

#### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mikecm1141/bike-share)

Bike Share was an interesting and challenging project. This application uses bike share
data from the Bay Area (provied by Kaggle) to do some analytics and business logic
on that data. We also incorporated a basic e-commerce engine to sell bike accessories, with
full cart functionality and the ability for admins to see orders by users.

The main feedback I took away from Bike Share was working on some polish details for
the interface, and working on being more specific and instructional in our Readme. There
were some opportunities for refactor in the models as well with our ActiveRecord calls. This
project had a high level of team work and I really enjoyed working with my group on
such a large project.


## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I love to help my peers! I find the most satisfaction from working on bugs and
other hurdles with others. I try to spend as much time as possible in Slack and
to try and be available during normal hours (and not so normal!). I would love to
be more active with cohorts below us in the future.
